The purpose of this project was to analyze the gender composition of the Mexican congress from 2010 to 2019 and understand if there is a relationship among this trend and the number of femicides in the country that have been on the rise. 
The number of women in congress and femicides have been increasing in the past decade and our results show a positive relationship between these variables. The increase in women's representation in Congress has been accompanied by an increase in the rate of femicides. However, we cannot establish a causal effect, we need a more robus analysis to do so.
